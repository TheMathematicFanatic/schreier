TreeAutomorphisms.py is a file intended for use with the animation library Manim.

If you are familiar with manim, the relevant scene is called Graph, and within this the section I used to post is apply_permutation_sequence.
The whole thing is super janky lol, especially the definitions of x and y. I was trying to design a class called TreePermutation to match with the way
we've been notating automorphisms, but could not get it to stop complaining about the self-referentiality required to define x and y (and many others) in this way.
If you know how to do this, please let me know!

If you are not familiar with manim but want to see a particular output just let me know. Or give it a go yourself, took me ages to learn fwiw:
